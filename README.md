## Overview of Project 

### Purpose
- the porpose of this project is to use VBA to creat macrows in excel. Macros can be programed to do various thing in a worksheet. From simple calcualations to more complicated processess. in this project we reviewed two diffrent data sets. One from 2017 and one from 2018. in this project we wer orgiaizing the stocks by name volume and the growth or decline of the stock within a year. We also did the same program two diffrent ways. 

### Results
- through out this challange i have discovered that using arrays is a much more efficent in programing. As shown in the diffrence of timing between image one and image two bellow

-where the first image shows the program that uses no arrays tool it was about .6 seconds slower than the second program which did use arrays. the scond program also had more visual edits.

### Summary
-in summary it is importnatn to know which tools to use in programing. Where in one situation it might have be beneficiatl to use a simpler program, in another it may have been far better to use a stremlined program.
